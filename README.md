algorithms updateboron-main.sh - downloader of the above and script that starts the update updateboron-scheduleportal - schedules portal update into /etc/crontab to start on each Friday, 23 oclock updateboron-scheduler - site PC scheduler with a menu

I scripted the above into tech.biositesystems.io/updateboron-scheduler. So the 1st line can just wget this script and run it. It will ask when and how to schedule update and update crontab file
